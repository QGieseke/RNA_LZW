\section{Introduction}
Detecting RNA secondary structures is a process which is integral to understanding the functions of non-coding RNA sequences. Though there are existing bioinformatics tools used for detection, these programs are not without their limitations. \\
Specifically, RNAz uses a sliding window approach in its analysis of a sequence [1], [2], meaning there may be structures with loops existing outside the scope of the window.\\
The Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm is a universal lossless compression algorithm used for a variety of applications such as Unix file compression. The algorithm compresses data by using a dictionary to assign common sequences of characters to a fixed-length code (typically 12-bit) [3].\\
Because RNA structure exists in a 3-dimensional capacity, with its final form assuming a tertiary structure, base pairings which may appear to be distant from one another in a secondary structure can in reality exist very closely to one another once their tertiary structure is assumed. Given the LZW algorithm’s dictionary approach to pattern-matching,  RNA\_LZW can detect the presence of distant pseudoknots in a structure in much the same way that it detects regular base pairing. \\
We propose that RNA\_LZW could serve as a pre-processing step to determine if there are notable base pairings throughout a given sequence, which may not be accounted for by standard secondary structure detection methods.

\section{algorithms}


\subsection{Lempel-Ziv-Welch Encoding}

RNA\_LZW uses only the encoding step of the LZW compression algorithm.  A high level overview of the encoding portion of the LZW algorithm as employed in RNA\_LZW is shown below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize the dictionary to contain all keys of length one. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In this case, the dictionary initially contains only four characters; A,U,C, and G. 
	\end{enumerate}
\item Initialize a buffer as the first character in the sequence.
\item Add characters from the sequence to the buffer until the buffer represents a key that is not already represented in the dictionary. Once the buffer is added to the dictionary as a key, it is reset to just the last character.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Though not represented in a normal LZW algorithm, RNZ\_LZW records additional metadata about the position of the buffer in the greater sequence into the dictionary.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Though LZW encoding normally cannot iterate multiple times due to its need to be decoded without the dictionary; RNA\_LZW acts with global information, and does not have that restriction, and therefore uses multiple iterations to build a much more robust dictionary.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Dot-Bracket Construction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the algo
\end{enumerate}


\section{results}

In order to test for RNA\_LZW's efficacy as a preprocessing(?) step in identifying potentially relevant stems and pseudoknots in a given structure, it was tested using sequences where the secondary structure is known.  All sequences used were sourced from the RNACentral database. The dot-bracket notations of these known sequences were then compared to the dot-bracket output generated by RNA\_LZW.


\subsection{Homo sapiens tRNA-SeC (anticodon TCA) 1-1 (TRU-TCA1-1)}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{for_paper1.png}
  \caption{Homo sapiens tRNA-SeC, generated using R2DT secondary structure visualization}
  \label{fig:tRNA}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:tRNA},  tRNAs are short sequences which serve as a good benchmark to visualize whether RNA\_LZW is capable of outputting structures that are at all similar to those obtained by tried and true methods of RNA secondary structure discovery. \\

\begin{table}
  \caption{Dot-Bracket Comparison}
  \label{tab:tRNA}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l}

\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\smallskip

\setlength{\parindent}{0cm}Clearly RNA\_Z cannot serve as a replacement for more accurate methods of secondary structure construction; however, the output in Table \ref{tab:tRNA} shows that RNA\_Z is capable of producing somewhat similar structural features to a known dot-bracket structure. \\
Due to the small size of this sequence, RNA\_Z's output is clearly less complete than the known structure, but the hypothesis that RNA\_Z is capable of matching base pairs from any range in the structure, is supported by the output generated from this sequence. 

\subsection{Homo sapiens telomerase RNA}

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein, meaning that it is a complex structure comprised of non-coding RNA and a protein binding to one another. Telomerase RNA contains a pseudoknot which is integral to telomerase's function [5].  Figure \ref{fig:telomerase} helps visualize how these pseudoknots appear in nature.\\
Though the length of the sequence (450 nucleotides) means that visual comparison will be difficult for the reader,  a \% similarity comparison is notable because [blah]\\

\section{discussion}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{conclusion}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}
